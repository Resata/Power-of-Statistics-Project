## 🧪 Automatidata – A/B Test on Payment Method and Fare Amount (Course 4)

A statistical analysis project completed as part of Course 4: The Power of Statistics in the Google Advanced Data Analytics program.
This project investigates whether the payment method (credit card vs. cash) is associated with differences in average fare amount for NYC Yellow Taxi trips. The analysis uses descriptive statistics and hypothesis testing to determine whether the observed differences are statistically significant and to translate the findings into actionable insights.


### 📌 Project Objectives
* Explore fare patterns across different payment methods


* Compare average fare amounts for credit card vs. cash payments


* Conduct a two-sample t-test to assess statistical significance


* Interpret results in a business context


* Communicate insights and limitations clearly



### 🧰 Technologies Used
* Python 3


* pandas, NumPy


* scipy.stats


* Jupyter Notebook



### 📊 Key Insights
* Credit card users appear to pay slightly higher fares on average than cash users.


* A statistical test indicates that this difference is unlikely due to random chance, suggesting a real difference in fare amounts between payment types.


* Although statistically significant, the effect size is modest, meaning the practical difference may be small.


* Certain assumptions (e.g., random assignment to payment method) may not hold in real-world taxi behavior, which can influence the result.


* Business strategies such as credit card–focused promotions could leverage this observed pattern, depending on broader context and additional analysis.
